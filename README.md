# Wave Portal 

Welcome! Due to my wave portal application codebase having various wallet addresses I am not able to post the code as that is sensitive information. 
However, this readme will explain how to interact with the application and how it works. 
First lets setup your metamask wallet to interact. 

Setup: 

1.) Go to the Metamask website
<br>
2.) Click “Get Chrome Extension” to install Metamask or go here to add it https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en
<br>
3.) Click “Add to Chrome” in the upper right
<br>
4.) Click “Add Extension” to complete the installation
<br>
5.) You will know Metamask has been installed when their is a fox logo on the top right corner of your browser
